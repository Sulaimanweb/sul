	The day I entered in our relationship, I left everythig back and never goona look back,<br> achiving you is my biggest dream and you are my priority in life.
	<br>
	There is no simple love stories. if it's simple,<br> it's not love, if it's love, it'll get complicated

	Qoute:(When I started to love you, I realized that I have never loved anyone like this before).<br> As i feel cheating dosen't mean you sleep with someone,<br> the day you go against your partner, there you are.
	<br>
	You don't hurt the people you love, i said you are right,<br> intentionally you don't but you always hurt people you love, you can't hurt somebody that you don't love.

			Teri hi baton pe maine 
			saja li hai duniya yahan
			dil ke darmiya
			baarishein hai baarishein

			ab tu aati hai bulati hai 
			bister sai yoon girati hai
			ki so-un mein 
			bahoon mein bas teri
